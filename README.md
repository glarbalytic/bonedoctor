# Bone Doctor

A Part IB (second year) Group Project, created for TPP for the **Computer Science Tripos** at the **University of Cambridge**.

## Problem statement

Large databases of labelled X-ray images such as the MURA dataset of broken bones can be used to train AI systems for medical advice. An intelligent clinical assistant should be able to take a previously unseen X-ray image and link it directly to cases that can guide possible treatment. Your task is to train a neural network that will find a variety of other cases that are clinically similar, but visually distinct, presented in a visual overlay that highlights local differences for a clinician to review. 

## Getting Started

1. `git clone git@github.com:jjurm/bonedoctor`
2. Download the MURA dataset and unzip it to `MURA-v1.1` inside the project directory
3. `./gradlew run` (or set your IDE appropriately)
